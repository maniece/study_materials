LIFE CYCLE HOOKS

A component has a lifecycle managed by Angular. Angular creates it, renders it, creates and renders its children, checks it when its data-bound properties change, and destroys it before removing it from the DOM.

ngOnChanges() ==> Respond when Angular (re)sets data-bound input properties. The method receives a SimpleChanges object of current and previous property values.
Called before ngOnInit() and whenever one or more data-bound input properties change.\

ngOnInit()==> Initialize the directive/component after Angular first displays the data-bound properties and sets the directive/component's input properties.
Called once, after the first ngOnChanges().

ngDoCheck()	==> Detect and act upon changes that Angular can't or won't detect on its own.
Called during every change detection run, immediately after ngOnChanges() and ngOnInit().

ngAfterContentInit()==>Respond after Angular projects external content into the component's view.
Called once after the first ngDoCheck().
A component-only hook.

ngAfterContentChecked()==>Respond after Angular checks the content projected into the component.
Called after the ngAfterContentInit() and every subsequent ngDoCheck().
A component-only hook.

ngAfterViewInit()==> Respond after Angular initializes the component's views and child views.
Called once after the first ngAfterContentChecked().
A component-only hook.

ngAfterViewChecked()==> Respond after Angular checks the component's views and child views.
Called after the ngAfterViewInit and every subsequent ngAfterContentChecked().
A component-only hook.

ngOnDestroy ==> Cleanup just before Angular destroys the directive/component. Unsubscribe Observables and detach event handlers to avoid memory leaks.
Called just before Angular destroys the directive/component.
